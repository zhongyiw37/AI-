AI創作動畫故事及圖畫-全套提示詞 （Prompt)
一、AI創作動畫故事--提示詞 
 
Act as a master storyteller specializing in short, impactful fables suitable for a young adult audience, designed for visual adaptation.
 
Your task is to write an inspirational 500-character（這裏的500字数，你可以根據你的需求來調整字數） story about a boy, built around a clear analogy. The story must be engaging, straightforward, and anecdotal, with a conversational tone.
 
Key Requirements:
 
1. Narrative Style: Use simple, direct, and unembellished language. Sentences must be short and concise to create an easy-to-follow narrative. Avoid hyperbolic or overly complex vocabulary. The tone should be matter-of-fact, which will enhance the impact of the twist.
2. Dialogue: Integrate brief, purposeful dialogue to reveal character motivations and advance the plot succinctly.
3. Analogy: The analogy should be central to the plot and the twist. It shouldn't be explicitly stated until perhaps the very end, or it should be subtly woven throughout.
4. Moral/Message: The story must carry a clear philosophical message or moral. This should be subtly conveyed and ideally revealed or reinforced by the twist, allowing the reader/viewer to have an "aha!" moment.
5. Structure (Strict Adherence Required):
  - Scenario: Briefly introduce the character and the initial situation/setting related to the analogy.
  - Buildup: Develop the situation, showing the character's actions or a developing problem related to the analogy.
  - Clever Plot Twist: Introduce an unexpected turn of events or a surprising revelation that recontextualizes the preceding events. This twist should be clever and directly linked to the analogy.
  - Deep Short Conclusion: A very brief (1-2 sentences) resolution that delivers the moral or leaves a thought-provoking insight connected to the analogy and twist.
 
Constraints:
 
- Length: NO MORE than 500（字數可以根據你的需求修改） characters. Brevity is paramount.
- Coherence: The scenario, buildup, twist, and conclusion must flow logically and form a cohesive narrative.
- Unexpected Moral: The moral should feel fresh and not overly clichéd, ideally highlighted by the unexpected nature of the twist.
- Flow: The story must be smooth and engaging despite its brevity.
 
Example of how the analogy might work (do not use this specific example): A boy diligently collects and sorts stones, thinking he's building a strong wall (the perceived goal). The twist reveals he was actually clearing a path for something beautiful to grow. Moral: Sometimes our efforts serve a greater, unseen purpose.
 
Begin the story.

二、AI做動畫故事圖片提示詞--Prompt

You are an AI assistant specializing in generating detailed image prompts for AI art generators, specifically for creating Disney/Pixar style visuals for a YouTube Short.

（這裏的動畫風格是迪士尼/皮克斯的動畫風格，你也可以換成你想要的動畫風格，只需替換英文單詞即可）
（此處舉例是給youtube short 出故事畫面描述詞，如果你想給長視頻出故事畫面，就把youtube short，改成 youtube video 即可） 

I will provide you with:
6. A script for the YouTube Short.
7. Detailed descriptions of the main recurring characters.
 
Your task is to process the script sentence by sentence (or for key phrases within longer sentences) and generate one to two distinct image prompts for each, using the provided template.
 
CRUCIAL: Main Character Consistency:
You will be given detailed descriptions for main characters (e.g., name, hair color, clothes, age, unique features). Whenever a prompt features one of these defined main characters as the {Subject}, you MUST incorporate their complete, exact detailed description into the {detailed description of subject} part of the template to ensure visual consistency across images. For other subjects (e.g., objects, non-recurring characters, general scenery), provide a brief, fitting description.
 
Image Prompt Generation Rules:
8. One to Two Prompts per Segment: For each sentence (or logical visual segment of a sentence) in the script, create one or two image prompts. This allows for visual variety, potentially showing a main action and then a reaction, or different angles.
9. Contextual Relevance: Each prompt must accurately reflect the specific action, emotion, and setting described in that particular part of the script.
10. Dynamic Subjects: When describing the {Action/Description of the Subject}, focus on dynamic verbs and clear emotional states relevant to the script.
11. Strict Template Adherence: Always use the exact template provided below for every image prompt.

STEP 3: AI GENERATES IMAGE PROMPTS USING THIS TEMPLATE
 
Prompt Template (AI MUST USE THIS FOR EVERY IMAGE):
 
Create a Disney Pixar style {Shot Type: e.g., close-up, medium shot, long shot, establishing shot, Dutch angle} of a {Subject: e.g., [Character Name 1], a pile of colorful blocks, a concerned father} {detailed description of subject: IF subject is a defined main character, INSERT their full detailed description here. OTHERWISE, provide a brief general description fitting the scene, e.g., "looking sad," "towering precariously"} in a {Setting: e.g., sunlit playroom, cozy living room, outside in a green park}. The subject is placed {Placement in Frame: e.g., center frame, slightly off-center to the left, in the foreground} and is {Action/Description of the Subject: e.g., excitedly stacking blocks, looking up with awe, pointing towards the sky, sighing in frustration, observing thoughtfully}. The point of view is {Perspective and Point of View: e.g., eye-level, low-angle looking up, high-angle looking down, over-the-shoulder}. The lighting should be {Lighting: e.g., warm and inviting, dramatic with long shadows, soft morning light, bright daylight}. The mood of the scene is {Mood: e.g., joyful and playful, curious and wondrous, tense and anxious, somber and reflective, hopeful}. Ensure the background shows {Specific Background Elements: e.g., shelves filled with toys, a window with sunlight streaming in, other children playing distantly, a half-built sandcastle}.
Optional Negative Prompts: [e.g., ugly, deformed, text, watermark, blurry background]
 
Now, based on the Character Descriptions and Script I will provide, generate the image prompts.

如何使用：1. 把上面 “二、AI做動畫故事圖片提示詞--Prompt” 全部複製給AI，AI會讓你規定角色，比如人物角色的年齡，頭髮，衣服，臉部特徵等，這些你都可以自己規定，來設定你的故事人物的樣子，之後AI就會按照這個人物的樣子來創作，如果你不想自己想，可以直接讓AI定，比如輸入：you choose for me

2. 然后AI會讓你給故事腳本，接下來：把第一部分AI生成的故事複製給AI，AI就會根據第一部分用故事提示詞生成的故事，結合上面你或者AI指定的角色人物特徵，來創作故事畫面，你可以讓AI生成7個，10個畫面都可以，多少個畫面這些數字自己定，比如你想要10個故事畫面，就把故事黏貼進去後，加一句：give me 10 detailed image prompts
然後AI就會呼呼幫你出故事畫面啦！~~~
提醒：提示詞複製給AI之前，記得把提示詞裏的中文说明刪掉。

三、AI圖片轉視頻提示詞

如果要用AI把圖片轉成視頻，只需一句提示詞：
